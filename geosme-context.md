## Core Features

Users can search for specific SMEs, bookmark businesses of interest, navigate to their physical locations, and contribute comments and reviews. The application serves as both a business directory and an interactive mapping platform for the local business community.

## Research Foundation

This application is built upon extensive client research that systematically gathered data on SMEs operating in Batangas. The primary focus of this research was to understand and document fintech adoption patterns among local small and medium enterprises.

Beyond basic business listings, the application incorporates sophisticated map visualization features that display research findings. The platform includes specialized map layers that illustrate different fintech solutions used by various SMEs, creating a visual representation of financial technology adoption across the province.

## Business Density Analytics

The application also features business heatmap layers that visualize SME density based on specific business categories across different municipalities and areas within Batangas. These category-specific heatmaps reveal market saturation levels for different types of businesses, enabling users to identify oversaturated markets and underserved areas. This granular analysis helps entrepreneurs understand competitive landscapes, discover market opportunities, and make strategic decisions about business location and category selection.

GeoSME Batangas includes a dedicated business portal that provides SME owners with access to a comprehensive dashboard containing valuable business metrics. Through this portal, business owners can monitor how many users are navigating to their physical locations, track engagement with their business listings, and respond directly to customer comments and reviews. Additionally, the portal offers competitor analysis tools that allow SME owners to assess other SMEs within the same business category and specific radius areas, providing targeted insights into directly relevant competitors and market positioning.
